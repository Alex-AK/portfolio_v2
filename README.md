[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/dc433559-2cbe-48d0-a6da-8dcd960517fa/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/alex-king/deploys)

#### Introduction
My portfolio began on a quiet Sunday morning at my local coffee shop. The aim was to make a stylistically unique and calm website to communicate my interests, values, as well as technical skills and offerings to new and existing clients.

#### Overview
By approaching this project from scratch with little outside design reference (I started with an actual piece of paper and pen), I was able to create a unique portfolio layout and design that aligns with my style, skills, and values. The color choice for this site (inspired by my local coffee shop) helps reinforce one of my core goals with this project - to communicate a calm and authentic energy.

After the initial foundation was set I began to focus my time on refining the user interface and user experience. Through several iterations and user feedback, I was able to refine my portfolio down to the essentials and publish the product you see today.

As with all of my work, my goal is to deliver a product that aligns with my clients values, vision, and goals. Being the client for this project, I am pleased to deliver and share my portfolio with you. If youâ€™re interested in working with me on existing or future projects, reach out and connect with me directly. I also regularly write to share my story and work which can be found here.

#### Summary
From a quiet Sunday morning coffee shop brainstorming session, portfolio was born. With scribbled design sketches and my ideal user experience in mind, I got to work. Once the basic structure of the site was in place I spent hours refining the styles and user experience to deliver the product you see today.

Starting a new project can be daunting, but with dedicated planning and detailed notes, I was able to deliver the site you see from start to finish in four weeks of development.
